Material Dashboard PRO React is a Premium Material-UI Admin created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. We are very excited to introduce our take on the material concepts through an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Material Dashboard PRO React was built over the popular Material-UI framework.

#### Special thanks
During the development of this dashboard, we have used many existing resources from awesome developers. We want to thank them for providing their tools open source:
+ [Perfect-scrollbar](https://github.com/utatti/perfect-scrollbar) for the slim and beautiful scrollbars.
+ [React-bootstrap-sweetalert](https://github.com/djorg83/react-bootstrap-sweetalert) for the wonderful alerts.
